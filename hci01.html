                <p id="tit">INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p>Previous work on olfactory interfaces design and development helped explore the possibilities of
                  using smell
                  sense in HCI and to engage a broader community to join in the relevant research. However, the design,
                  implementation, and applications of theseworks are not easily modified or extended. To further lower
                  the barrier of entry to olfactory interface design and to facilitate rapid prototyping, we propose
                  O&O,
                  a modular olfactory interface DIY toolkit. The toolkit contains: <code>Scent Delivery Kit</code>,
                  supporting most common
                  vaporization and transmission techniques used in this area; <code>Cardboard Structure Kit</code>,
                  handling the structures
                  of different functional modules; <code>Design Manual</code>, assisting design thinking and introducing
                  the toolkit itself.
                  We organized a formal workshop with19 participants and four solo DIY trials to evaluate its usability
                  and to
                  explore how users engage in olfactory interface design, theircreations using the toolkit in short/long
                  periods,
                  and their suggestions for the toolkit. Finally, Design implications were discussed for further
                  research.</p>

                <p id="tit">SCENT GENERATION KIT</p>
                <p class="subtit">1 | Driver Modules</p>
                <img src="images/portfolio/hci10/circuit.jpg" class="imgitem">
                <p>The toolkit contains two sets of driver modules for <code>ultrasonic atomizer</code> and components
                  supporting <code>PWM control</code>
                  (fan, heater, air pump, motor). All modules support <code>manual</code> and
                  <code>program</code>control modes. Manual mode means that
                  users can directly control the modules with passive switches(e.g. buttons), while program mode is
                  controlled by Arduino programs.
                  We have both basic (27mm * 33mm) and pro (33mm * 40mm) version of modules for each type of output
                  components.
                  To further reduce memory costs, all driver modules have a <code>unified layout</code> with control
                  ports in the lower-left corner,
                  power ports in the lower-right corner, and output ports in the upper-right corner. The control ports
                  of the two basic
                  modules are identical to the standard IO ports (digital I/O, VCC, GND) of the Arduino module.</p>

                <p class="subtit">2&3 | Optional Accessories & Output Components</p>
                <img src="images/portfolio/hci10/output.jpg" class="imgitem">
                <p>The toolkit provides optional accessories including <code>scent sources</code>, <code>control components</code>,
                  and <code>connection parts</code> to
                  ease the scent generation process. It also contains four categories of output components:
                  <code>atomizers</code>,<code>heaters</code>,<code>fans</code>,and<code>air pumps</code>.The project tested
                  and offered multiple components with various specifications for each category. Users may also adopt their own.

              <p>A rich abstraction of modules is crucial for any creation. The toolkit provides four sizes of modules 
                for every application category depicted in the design section (70mm, 40mm, 30mm, 20mm) and provided cardboard
                 templates with various primitive form or self-design options (square, cylinder, flat, polyhedron ,or free-design). 
                 Notice: the project proposed the "polyhedron" module to provide an inspiration for creating new structures. 
                 Considering the cognitive load for novice users and the complexity of the module structure, we did not 
                 provide physical materials for this module in the subsequent demos and studies.

              <p>The three scent generation technologies rely on different technical principles in system operation and 
                require customized modular structures for implementation.

              <p class="subtit">3 | Transmission Module</p>
              <img src="images/portfolio/hci10/transmission.jpg" class="imgitem">
              <p>The toolkit designs five types of square modules based on the <code>main characteristics of odor transmission</code>
                (distance, volume, patterns, horizontal directions, vertical directions. These modules can help users adapt to 
                different transmission needs and can also act as inspiration for more transmission functions.

                              <img src="images/portfolio/hci10/handling.jpg" class="imgitem">
              <p>Traditional olfactory interfaces are usually constructed with well-textured materials such as 3D printed plastics, 
                metal, and wood. Designing and prototyping olfactory interfaces using cardboard is a challenge because the fiber 
                texture is not well-suited for "association with odor" in many aspects, such as <code>water resistance</code> ,
                 <code>absorption of odor</code>, <code>heat resistance</code>. Here the design provide some proven solutions 
                 to these concerns.

                <p>Prototyping is both a skill and a mindset. The aptitude to rapidly generate 
                  and evolve ideas is a prerequisite for creating and engaging human-centered 
                  olfactory interfaces. When users feel limited in their knowledge and ideas
                  about the olfactory interaction realm, the design manual walks them through 
                  systematic brainstorm. We structured the design manual into five corresponding 
                  sections by adopting the popular five-stage process of design thinking, empathize, 
                  define(problem), ideate, prototype, and test.</p>

                  O&O can be employed to support the design and prototyping phase of olfactory applications. 
                  Each prototype relates to the five common olfactory interface forms summarized in the design 
                  section and can easily be extended with further design and development.</p>

                <p>To gain preliminary understanding of the usability of the toolkit, how and what users could build with O&O and 
                  to gain issues and feedback, we conducted a formal workshop with <code>19</code> participants in <code>6</code>
                  groups. Our findings were used to refine the toolkit as well as our further evaluation approach.</p>
                  <p>The study used a mixed-methods approach to analyze the collected data, including <code>pre-and post-study questionnaires</code>,
                    <code>transcribed interviews</code>, <code>video recordings</code>, and <code>final prototypes</code> presented by each group.
                     Firstly, my director and I  analyzed the questionnaire results to obtain the quantitative evaluation of the toolkit 
                     and the impact of the user's previous expertise (DIY, programming) on the rating. 
                     Secondly, we conducted thematic coding and classification of the interview and video content, 
                     and used the results to derive qualitative findings and the corresponding discussion. </p>

                  especially for participants without programming knowledge. Allowing users to carry out DIY projects 
                  for longer periods (for example, 3 to 4 days) independently can provide them with a greater creative
                   space and freedom.</p>

                  <p>The two <code>STEM education teachers</code> who participated in the workshop felt very positively about our toolkit. 
                    One expressed the wish to introduce the kit in the curriculum to support teaching and learning, and the other felt that it was 
                    a very good entry point for children's education and for children to learn about the world from the perspective of smell. 
                    This inspired to transform O\&O into a STEM education tool, as it will not only benefit young people's creative education, but
                     also inform them on olfaction-related research and contribute to future talent development in this field of study.
